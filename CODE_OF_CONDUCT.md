# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We are committed to providing a welcoming and respectful environment for everyone contributing to or using zcash-txshape. We ask that participants uphold the same care and respect that the Zcash community holds for privacy and technical rigor.

## Expected Behavior

- Be respectful of differing views and experience levels.
- Accept constructive criticism and focus on what is best for the project and the community.
- Refrain from behavior that could be considered harassing, discriminatory, or unprofessional.

## Unacceptable Behavior

Harassment, trolling, or personal or political attacks are not acceptable. Likewise, using the project to facilitate privacy violations or attribution of real-world identities is contrary to the project’s non-goals and is not acceptable.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies to project spaces (repositories, issue trackers, discussions) and to public communication when representing the project.

## Enforcement

Maintainers may remove or edit content that violates this code and may temporarily or permanently block contributors who do not follow it. Reports can be made to the project maintainers.
